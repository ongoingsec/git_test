        <h1>first basic template webpage on website i guess oh and heading 1</h1>
        <h2>this is heading 2</h2>
        <h3>this is heading 3</h3>
        <h4>this is heading 4</h4>
        <h5>this is heading 5</h5>
        <h6>this is heading 6</h6>
        <strong>this is strong text to put emphasis for like accessibility and stuff</strong>
        <p>though if were speaking <strong>realistically</strong> you will
          probably find yourself using the strong element much more in
          combination with other text elements, like this </p>

        <p>Sometimes you will want to make text bold without giving it an
          important meaning. Youâ€™ll learn how to do that in the CSS </p>

        <h2>Em Element</h2>
        <p>The em element makes text italic. It also semantically places emphasis
          on the text, which again affects things like screen readers. To define
           an emphasised element we wrap text content in a em> tag. To use em on
            its own:</p>

            <em>this is an example of emphasized text</em>
          <p>Again, like the strong element, you will 
            find yourself mostly using the em element 
            with other text elements:</p>

          <h2>Nesting and Indentation</h2>
          <p>You may have noticed that in all the examples in this lesson we 
            indent any elements that are within other elements. This is known 
            as nesting elements.
            When we nest elements within other elements, we create a parent and 
            child relationship between them. The nested elements are the children 
            and the element they are nested within is the parent.</p>

            <p>just as in human relationships, HTML parent elements can have many 
              children. Elements at the same level of nesting are considered to be 
              siblings.</p>

            <p>We use indentation to make the level of nesting clear and readable for 
              ourselves and other developers who will work with our HTML in the future. 
              It is recommended to indent any child elements by two spaces.
              it is just important to know the distinction between how elements are 
              related and the terminology used to describe their relationships.</p>

         <h2>HTML Comments</h2>

         <p>HTML comments are not visible to the browser; they allow us to comment on 
           our code so that other developers or our future selves can read them and get 
           some context about something that might not be clear in the code.

          Writing an HTML comment is simple: we just put <;!-- and --> at either end of the comment.</p>

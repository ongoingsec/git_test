    <h2>Anchor Elements</h2>

    <p>To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. An anchor element is defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element we want to be a link with a
        <;a> tag.</p>

    <a href="">click me ! </a>

    <a>fake link hahah</a>

    <p>may have noticed that clicking this link doesnt do anything. because an anchor tag on its own wont know where to link to. have to tell it a destination to go to. do this by using an HTML attribute.</p>

    <p>HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the elements opening tag. An attribute is made up of two parts, a name, and a value. In our case, we need to add a href (hyperlink reference) attribute to the opening
        anchor tag. The value of the href attribute is the destination we want our link to go to.
    </p>

    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">now click me!</a>

    <p>By default, any text wrapped with an anchor tag without a href attribute will look like plain text. If the href attribute is present, the browser will give the text a blue color and underline it to signify it is a link.</p>

    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me now</a>

    <a href="./pages/about.html">my about i guess</a>

    <p>Its worth noting you can use anchor tags to link to any kind of resource on the internet, not just other HTML documents. You can link to videos, pdf files, images, and so on, but for the most part, you will be linking to other HTML documents.
    </p>

    <h2>absolute and relative paths</h3>

        <p>there are two kinds of links we will create: Links to pages on other websites on the internet Links to pages located on our own websites
        </p>

        <h3>Absolute Links</h3>

        <p>Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: protocol://domain/path. An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination.
            <br> Weve already seen an absolute link in action. The link we created to The Odin Projects About page earlier was an absolute link as it contains the protocol and domain.</p>

        <h3>Relative Links</h3>

        <p>Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.
            <br> Relative links only include the file path to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on. </p>
        <p>Open the index file in a browser and click on the about link to make sure it is all wired together correctly. Clicking the link should go to the about page we just created.
            <br> This works because the index and about page are in the same directory. That means we can simply use the name of the about.html file about.html as the value of the href in the link.
            <br> But we will usually want to organize our website directories a little better. Normally we would only have the index.html at the root directory and all other HTML files in their own directory.</p>
        <p>In many cases, this will work just fine; however, you can still run into unexpected issues with this approach. Prepending ./ before the link will in most cases prevent such issues. By adding ./ you are specifying to your code that it should start
            looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory.</p>
        <p>Absolute and relative links are a tricky concept to build a good mental model of, a metaphor may help: Think of the directory in which a website is located as a house, and each page on the website as a room in that house. Relative links are directions
            from the room you are currently in (the bedroom) to another room (the kitchen). Absolute links, on the other hand, are directions to an entirely different house.
        </p>

        <h2>Images</h2>

        <p>Websites would be fairly boring if they could only display text. Luckily HTML provides a wide variety of elements for displaying all sorts of different media. The most widely used of these is the image element. To display an image in HTML we use
            the img> element. Unlike the other elements we have encountered so far, the <img> element is empty. Which means it doesnâ€™t have a closing tag. Instead of wrapping content with an open and closing tag, it embeds an image into the page using
            a src attribute which tells the browser where the image file is located. The src attribute works much like the href attribute for anchor tags. It can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths.</p>

        <p>with absolute path we can display an image located on The Odin Project site:</p>


        <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="">

        <p>To use images that we have on our own websites, we can use a relative path.</p>

        <img src="./images/dog.png" alt="charles the dog">

        <h2>Parent Directories </h2>

        <p>What if we want to use the dog image in the about page? We would first have to go up one level out of the pages directory into its parent directory so we could then access the images directory. To go to the parent directory we need to use two
            dots in the relative filepath like this: ../. </p>

        <p>Using the metaphor we used earlier, using ../ in a filepath is kind of like stepping out from the room you are currently in to the main hallway so you can go to another room.
        </p>

        <h2>Alt attribute</h2>

        <p>Besides the src attribute, every image element should also have an alt(alternative text) attribute. The alt attribute is used to describe an image, it will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. It is also used with screen readers
            to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.</p>

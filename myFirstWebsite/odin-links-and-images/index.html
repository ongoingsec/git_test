        <h2>Anchor Elements</h2>

            <p>To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. 
            An anchor element is defined by wrapping the text or 
            another HTML element we want to be a link with a <;a> tag.</p>

                <a href="">click me ! </a>

                <a>fake link hahah</a>

            <p>may have noticed that clicking this link doesnt do anything. 
            because an anchor tag on its own wont know where to link to. 
            have to tell it a destination to go to. do this by using 
            an HTML attribute.</p>

            <p>HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element 
                and always goes in the elements opening tag. An attribute is 
                made up of two parts, a name, and a value. In our case, we need 
                to add a href (hyperlink reference) attribute to the opening anchor tag. 
                The value of the href attribute is the destination we want our link to go 
                to.</p>

                <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">now click me!</a>

            <p>By default, any text wrapped with an anchor tag without a href attribute 
                will look like plain text. If the href attribute is present, the browser 
                will give the text a blue color and underline it to signify it is a link.</p>
